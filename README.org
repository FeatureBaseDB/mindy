Mindy - a Multi-INDex proxY.

*** Get
(Assuming you've installed Go)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
go get github.com/pilosa/mindy/cmd/mindy
#+END_SRC
This may throw errors, but it should clone the repository into your GOPATH.

*** Build
(Assuming you've installed dep)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
dep ensure
go install github.com/pilosa/mindy/cmd/mindy
#+END_SRC

*** Running
To see most up to date help: =mindy -h=

*** Use
Mindy starts a server at (by default) =localhost:10001=. It accepts queries of
the form mindy.Request (in json), then constructs a Pilosa query, queries Pilosa
index by index and slice by slice, and streams results back line by line in the
form =<index>,<column>=.

*** Example
Running mindy with defaults, one might submit a request as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl -XPOST localhost:10001/mindy -d '
{
  "indexes":["1"], 
  "includes":[{"frame":"a","id":1}], 
  "excludes":[], 
  "conjunction":"and"
}'
#+END_SRC

Results can be read back a line at a time as they become available. Look at
client.go and how it is used in =mindy_test.go= for an example of doing this in
Go.
